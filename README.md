# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project provides a **RESTful API** for managing stock information stored in a **PostgreSQL database**. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete stock records efficiently.

## Key Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for stock data.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Uses PostgreSQL as the primary data storage.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a standard RESTful interface for interacting with stock data.
- **Gorilla Mux Router**: Uses Gorilla Mux for request routing and handling.
- **.env Configuration**: Uses godotenv to manage environment variables, such as the database connection string.

## Supported Platforms or Requirements
- **Go 1.16 or higher**
- **PostgreSQL database**
- **Dependencies:**
  - `lib/pq` (PostgreSQL driver)
  - `github.com/gorilla/mux` (Router)
  - `github.com/joho/godotenv` (Environment variable management)

# Getting Started

## Installation or Setup Instructions
### Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd go-postgres-stocks-yt
```

### Create a `.env` file:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content, replacing the placeholder with your actual PostgreSQL connection string:
```sh
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://user:password@host:port/database"
```
**Note:** Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.

### Install dependencies:
```sh
go mod download
go mod tidy
```

### Run the application:
```sh
go run main.go
```
The server will start on port **8080**.

# Dependencies or Prerequisites

### **Go**
Make sure Go is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Go website:
[Go Official Download](https://golang.org/dl/)

### **PostgreSQL**
You need a running PostgreSQL database instance. You can download and install it from the official PostgreSQL website:
[PostgreSQL Official Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### **Go Packages**
The following Go packages are required and will be installed using `go mod`:
- `github.com/gorilla/mux`
- `github.com/joho/godotenv`
- `github.com/lib/pq`

# Code Structure
```
go-postgres-stocks-yt/
├── middleware/
│   └── handlers.go      # Contains the handler functions for API endpoints.
├── models/
│   └── models.go        # Defines the data models (Stock).
├── router/
│   └── router.go        # Configures the API routes using Gorilla Mux.
├── go.mod               # Go module file for dependency management.
├── main.go              # Entry point of the application.
```

# Key Components
- **`main.go`**: The main application file that initializes the router and starts the HTTP server.
- **`router/router.go`**: Defines the API routes and associates them with the corresponding handler functions in the middleware package.
- **`middleware/handlers.go`**: Contains the handler functions that implement the API logic, including database interactions.
- **`models/models.go`**: Defines the `Stock` struct, which represents the data structure for stock information.
